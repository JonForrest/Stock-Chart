Say the user wants information 
From: 2005-10-07 1:03PM 
To: 2007-1-20 3:40PM 

What would I have to do?

-figure out what months(of years) to call the API for
    - use .getFullYear() and .getMonth() on both giving you:
        - 2005 - 10 (startyear and startmonth)
        - 2007 - 1 (endyear and endmonth)
    -write a for loop that populates a JSON  with year:month value pairs 
    
    
    for(let year=startyear; year<=endyear; year++){
        if(year=startyear){
            for(let month=startmonth; month<=12; month++){
                [call API for Year and Month perferablly through predefined fucnction]
                [pushes returned data onto array ]
            }
        }
        if(year=endyear){
            for(let month=1; month<=endmonth; month++){
                [call API for Year and Month perferablly through predefined fucnction]
                [pushes returned data onto array ]
            }

        }
        else{
             for(let month=1; month<=12; month++){
                [call API for Year and Month perferablly through predefined fucnction]
                [pushes returned data onto array ]
            }

        }
    }
